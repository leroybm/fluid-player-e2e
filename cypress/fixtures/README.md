# Fixtures

## VAST Fixtures

Create VAST fixtures by making a directory with the XML name (without the extension), and adding the fixtures inside it.

For example, if you are trying to create a fixture for the `vast_cta.xml` file, create a `vast_cta` directory,
then add the fixture file inside of it.
